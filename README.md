## Front Page
Contains basic information, and a link to the Discord channel.

The page is then populated by blog posts. 

## Blogs
Contains a list of all blog posts made.

## Wiki
A structured wiki with guide articles made by the community.
This can be hidden until there is some content.

## About us
Small details about the community, including links to any and all mentions.
Also a small info about the people who created the wiki.
